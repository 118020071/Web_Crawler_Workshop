            <p>Intro: the event is trigged by event handler
                in JavaScript, e.g. functions as event occured. 

                Events include onclick event, and onload event as
                the webpage is opened.

                Steps on creating event, 
                1st is to choose element as used before, and write it
                inside html, with xxx onclick="xxxx()".
                2nd is to choose the type of event we wanna use,
                e.g. onclick, or multiple events.

            <p id="para" onmouseover="changeBackground()" onmouseout="backNormal()"> 
                on mouse over event, and on mouse out event
            </p>

            <!-- <p>Do you wanna see real <span id=img1 onmouseover="newPic()" onmouseout="oldPic()">trump</span>? </p> -->
