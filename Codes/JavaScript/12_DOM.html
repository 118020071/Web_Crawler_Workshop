        <p>
            You can go up (from child to parent).
            Or you can go down (from parent to Child).
            Or you can go sideway (from sibling to Sibling, to the right or to the left).

        <h2>###AFTERMATH OF THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
        <p id='p3'>
        ###After the horrific defeat at the Battle of Cannae, the Romans reinstituted 
        Fabius' avoidance strategy.  The Romans no longer refused to meet Hannibal in 
        head on collisons.  Rather the Roman army kept a watchful eye on Hannibal, but 
        always at a close distance.
        </p>
        <p id='p4'>
        ###The avoidance strategy worked but it took forever.  It took almost two long 
        decades to drive Hannibal out of Italy.  And even then Hannibal was never 
        defeated in Italy.  The Romans, adopting a tactic out of Hannibal's playbook, 
        launched an attack against Carthage itself. This forced Hannibal to travel back 
        to Africa to defend the city.  Here he was defeated at the Battle of Zama.
