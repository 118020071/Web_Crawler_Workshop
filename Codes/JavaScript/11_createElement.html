<h2>HANNIBAL - THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
<p>
After defeating the Romans at the Battle of Lake Trasimene, Hannibal now moved 
his forces down south.  There was panic in Rome and Quintus Fabius Maximus was 
appointed dictator to deal with Hannibal.  Fabius, however, refused to meet 
Hannibal in the open field and this strategy became highly unpopular in Rome.  
Romans were used to attacking, not hiding.  The Romans were forced to 
go on the offensive after Hannibal positioned his forces betweeen Rome and 
it's vital grain supply.  This setup the epic Battle of Cannae.  Here Hannibal 
defeated the Romans inflicting the worst single day defeat in Rome's history.
</p>

<p>
The Romans were then forced to retreat to Rome.  It was a total defeat.
</p>

<h2>AFTERMATH OF THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
<p>
After the horrific defeat at the Battle of Cannae, the Romans reinstituted 
Fabius' avoidance strategy.  The Romans no longer refused to meet Hannibal in 
head on collisons.  Rather the Roman army kept a watchful eye on Hannibal, but 
always at a close distance.
</p>
<p>
The avoidance strategy worked but it took forever.  It took almost two long 
decades to drive Hannibal out of Italy.  And even then Hannibal was never 
defeated in Italy.  The Romans, adopting a tactic out of Hannibal's playbook, 
launched an attack against Carthage itself. This forced Hannibal to travel back 
to Africa to defend the city.  Here he was defeated at the Battle of Zama.
