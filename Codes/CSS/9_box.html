        Means and variances of asset returns must lie in the wedge-shaped region illustrated in Figure 1. The boundary of the mean-variance region in which assets can lie is called the mean-variance frontier. It answers a naturally interesting question, “how much mean return can you get for a given level of variance?”

        We can plot the <i>decomposition</i> of a return into a “priced” or “systematic” component and a “residual,” or “idiosyncratic” component as shown in Figure 1. The priced part is perfectly correlated with the discount factor, and hence perfectly correlated with any frontier asset. The residual or idiosyncratic part generates no expected return, so it lies flat as shown in the figure, and it is uncorrelated with the discount factor or any frontier asset..

        Obvious ways of <i>generalizing</i> the calculation just make matters worse. Equation (1.20) relates consumption growth to the mean-variance frontier of all contingent claims. The mar- ket indices with 0.5 Sharpe ratios are if anything inside that frontier, so recognizing market incompleteness will only make matters worse. Aggregate consumption has about 0.2 cor- relation with the market return, while the equality (1.20) takes the worst possible case that consumption growth and asset returns are perfectly correlated. If you add this fact, you need risk aversion of 250 to explain the market Sharpe ratio in the face of 1% consumption volatil- ity! Individuals have riskier consumption streams than aggregate, but as their risk goes up their correlation with any aggregate must decrease proportionally, so to first order recogniz- ing individual risk will not help either.

        The choice of discrete vs. continuous time is one of modeling convenience. The richness of the theory of continuous time processes often allows one to obtain analytical results that would be unavailable in discrete time. On the other hand, in the complexity of most practical situations, one often ends up resorting to numerical simulation of a discretized model anyway. In those cases, it might be clearer to start with a discrete model. But I emphasize this is all a choice of language. One should become familiar enough with discrete as well as continuous time representations of the same ideas to pick the representation that is most convenient for a particular application.

        Which is the chicken and which is the egg? Which variable is exogenous and which is en- dogenous? The answer is, neither, and for many purposes, it doesn’t matter. The first order conditions characterize any equilibrium; if you happen to know E(mx), you can use them to determine p; if you happen to know p, you can use them to determine consumption and sav- ings decisions.
