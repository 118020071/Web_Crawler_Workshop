        <!-- block element: the horizontal line throughout 
        the browser(take whole space), and auto-sized.

        But the width of it can be less than the width
        of browser window. There are link-break betweem
        blocks.
        We can nest block element within block element-->

        <!-- inline element are limited in a element/
        sized accordingly to the content, e.g. image.
        Image inline element has margin all around,
        but span inline element's margin is only on the left
        and right, no top or bottom margin tho. Special
        case see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzWDDOwFPCA&list=PLr6-GrHUlVf8JIgLcu3sHigvQjTw_aC9C&index=31
        -->

        <!-- inline element is usually converted into block
        element, tho blcok can be converted into inline. Code is
        display:block; ->> display:inline; 
        Block element is stacked vertically while inline element
        is stacked horizontally first. Also inline element cannot
        be centered.-->

                Stingrays are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters throughout the world. Some species, such as Dasyatis thetidis, are found in warmer temperate oceans, and others, such as Plesiobatis daviesi, are found in the deep ocean. The river stingrays, and a number of whiptail stingrays (such as the Niger stingray), are restricted to fresh water. Most myliobatoids are demersal (inhabiting the next-to-lowest zone in the water column), but some, such as the pelagic stingray and the eagle rays, are pelagic.

            The flattened bodies of stingrays allow them to effectively conceal themselves in their environments. Stingrays do this by agitating the sand and hiding beneath it. Because their eyes are on top of their bodies and their mouths on the undersides, stingrays cannot see their prey after capture; instead, they use smell

            This is really true for everything you believe especially when you are young. however these nonsense still works whenyou are old. That is no matter what age you are at, you have chance to believe in truth. truth is relatively related to your own personal experience. what you have seen or what you have learn really decide who you are and what you tend to believe. believe in truth means dis-believe in false, it can be risky tho. since the image is a little bit large, i just keep bullshitting. i am eager for love tho but i am not ready for relationship. i have been hidding from responsibility for fear and for the future. the not sure about my own future largely limit my choice, i want academic honor, i want sweet home, but there is no way achieve both and no way to expect at this early stage. so i quit because i am so cowardly at that. god i still need to type a lot to fill in the space. okay, my friend is in a relationship and it takes him a lot of time and enery to maintain the relationship, and both side do not know how to carry on after graduation. it is quite a conflict.

        <!-- relative positioning, use 2 of top/bottom/left/right 
        it just move from the div or latest static element,
        not so stronger than absolute positioning. It can
        put things inside a div, not just in whole window.
    Usage: subelement is absolutely positioned, mother-element
    is relatively positioned-->
